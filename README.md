# Dogs v. Cats

This is a quick litle project I made to get some experience working the the Fetch API.

## How It's Made:

**Built with:** <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/html5/html5-original-wordmark.svg" alt="html5" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/css3/css3-original-wordmark.svg" alt="css3" width="40" height="40"/><img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="40" height="40"/>

The project was supposed to use four APIs, two (facts and photos) for each animal. However, I had some technical difficulties with the facts APIs, so I ended up storing the data locally instead. The APIs are only used for the photos.

As I had decided to make a dog/cat switcher, it occured to me that this would be a good opportunity to make a light/dark theme switcher, a project I had never attempted before. It turned out to be simple: just use a bit of Javascript to add a "dark" id to the body, and then provide the relevant dark mode CSS.

## Optimizations

- set up a proper API for the facts (or at least move the data out of main.js)
- make it more responsive

## Lessons Learned:

- Dark mode is easy! 
- Some public APIs have CORS problems or other technical issues, be prepared to find alternatives
- The phrase "it's raining cats and dogs" has a horrific origin
